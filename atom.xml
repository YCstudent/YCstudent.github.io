Smith and Gao [1] found that 85% of respondents preferred online shopping for its convenience, as it allows consumers to shop from home without dealing with traffic or parking. This ease of access, combined with the ability to shop at any time, makes online shopping a highly attractive option for many. Additionally, online platforms offer a wide selection of products, with 78% of consumers appreciating the variety available compared to physical stores. This not only makes shopping more convenient but also helps consumers find the best deals [1]. In contrast, Anderson and Rogers [2] pointed out that onsite shopping still appeals to many consumers because of the immediate access to products and services.</p><p>The ability to inspect products physically, coupled with personalized customer service and the social aspect of shopping, contributes to the appeal of traditional shopping experiences. While online shopping may offer greater convenience, the in-person shopping experience still holds value for those who prefer tactile experiences and personalized service. It is clear possible that consumers’ perceptions of convenience are shaped not only by time and effort but also by the type of shopping experience they value. For many, the choice between online and onsite shopping probably depends on the specific needs of the moment—whether it is the speed and comfort of online shopping or the immediate satisfaction of interacting with products in person.</p><p>In conclusion, convenience seems to be a critical factor in consumers’ shopping decisions. While online shopping has the advantage of time-saving and product variety, onsite shopping remains relevant due to its unique convenience in providing immediate access to products and social interaction.</p><h3 id="Example-2">Example 2</h3><p>A significant factor that influences consumer decisions on whether to shop online or onsite could be the price as it plays a crucial role in shaping shopping preferences.</p><p>Smith and Gao [1] found that 72% of respondents reported that they often find better prices online than in physical stores. The ability to compare prices across different online platforms makes it easier for consumers to find the best bargains, which is a major draw of online shopping. Additionally, the lack of overhead costs for online retailers often results in lower prices for consumers compared to brick-and-mortar stores [1]. In contrast, Anderson and Rogers [2] noted that while online shopping often offers better prices, onsite shopping also has a price advantage in some cases. For example, 65% of consumers in their study reported that they valued the immediate purchase and possession of products in physical stores, which might justify slightly higher prices due to the lack of waiting time and shipping costs associated with online shopping [2].</p><p>It is likely that price is a major determining factor for many consumers when deciding between online and onsite shopping. Online shopping may offer a wider range of price comparisons, giving consumers more opportunities to find the best deal. However, onsite shopping can provide value in terms of immediate access to goods and avoiding shipping fees. Both pricing factors play an essential role in influencing consumers’ shopping behavior, and their decision often depends on their urgency to acquire a product or their willingness to wait for online delivery.<br>In conclusion, price seems to be a crucial factor that shapes consumer preferences because online platforms offer lower prices and better deals due to reduced overheads, while onsite shopping remains relevant for those who prioritize immediate possession of products.</p><h2 id="Recommendations">Recommendations</h2><h3 id="Example-1-2">Example 1</h3><p><strong>3.1 Recommendation for the requester</strong></p><p>The research indicates a potential strategy that the academic board of the University of Halleyville can adopt to decrease the level of plagiarism in the writing and speaking of international students. The research reveals that international students’ English language level may not be adequate to meet the demands of their degrees. The University of Halleyville should ensure that students are only accepted into courses when they demonstrate that they have the English skills that they need to be successful, and they should provide English support and teaching to help students achieve that level before they start. This will help avoid putting students in a situation where they are overwhelmed by the workload or struggling to paraphrase adequately.</p><p><strong>3.2 Recommendation for further research</strong></p><p>The given research does not include the explanations of international students themselves about why they plagiarise. Therefore, it is recommended that further research is conducted to  collect information directly from international students who have been penalised for plagiarism about why they breached academic integrity expectations. It is likely that the students themselves would have insight into their behaviour which could be useful for the University of Halleyville in devising strategies to support them.</p><h3 id="Example-2-2">Example 2</h3><p><strong>3.1 Recommendation for the requester</strong></p><p>Based on the analysis, it may be recommended that the academic board of the University of Halleyville should adopt an effective way of teaching to decrease the level of plagiarism in the writing and speaking of international students. In the literature review, it is found that different cultural backgrounds do not seem to affect international students’ understanding of plagiarism in general, but in some cases, it may affect their decision on when it is appropriate to use citing and which sources require it.  This problem can be addressed by the University of Halleyville changing the way that it teaches its students to cite sources.  These lessons should include a more detailed explanation of the different types of sources that students may encounter when conducting their research. This can improve a student’s understanding of the purpose of citing sources and give them the opportunity to put what they have learned into a cultural context, rather than just learning the basic format of each type of reference.</p><p><strong>3.2 Recommendation for further research</strong></p><p>One major limitation in the research is the size of selection in research participants. There are not enough international students interviewed about their view of using expert’s work in their assignment tasks. In one study, the results of plagiarism are only based on one survey of 178 both international and domestic students, and in the other study, only 115 students were involved in the investigation. The research results based on such small research samples may not represent larger groups of international students. Therefore, it is recommended that further research should be conducted in widening the selecting research participants from different cultural background to get a balanced view on the issue of plagiarism in academic work. By doing this, the University of Halleyville may get more accurate data on the causes of plagiarism and the insightfulness on different understandings of citing experts’ sources to assist the international students better prepared for Western education practices.</p><p><a href="/assets/PRACTICE.docx">Material</a><br><a href="/assets/criteria1.xlsx">Marking Criteria</a></p>]]></content>

The table compares the number of residents born in the UK,China and India who live in Sydney and Melbourne.224,685 people who live in Sydney were born in China,which was more than those born in the U.K.with 180,245 or India with 130,573.However,the largest number of foreign born people from the three countries who live in Melbourne is from India with 161,078,followed by China with 155,998 and the U.K. with 133,300.Overall, more people who were born in the U.K,China and India live in Sydney than in Melbourne.(Irvine 2018,p.41)</p><h3 id="Bar-chart">Bar chart</h3><p>eg. The bar chart compares the popularity of different locations chosen by students for carrying out their research. The highest number of students, around 515, did research at home. Amongst the locations at the university, the most popular was the university library with approximately 460 students, followed by the computer lab with about 355 students, and slightly fewer than 300 students using other locations on campus. The least popular choice, at around 270 students, was conducting research off campus in locations other than at home. Overall, studying at home was the most popular place for students, but more students preferred doing their research on campus than off campus (Lee 2016, p. 12).</p><p>eg. The bar chart compares the type of pets that are owned by people who are residents of Highcliff Apartments. Dogs and cats are the most popular pets at Highcliff Apartments with around 34 and 29 owned respectively. Birds are less popular than cats and dogs with approximately 17 animals kept, but lizards and snakes are the least popular pets with about 11 and 8 of them kept respectively. In conclusion, mammals are the most popular type of pet at Highcliff Apartments, followed by reptiles and birds (Irvine 2017, p. 41).</p><p>eg. The bar chart shows the comparison of spending on different sectors by the Australian government from 1950 to 2010. Health and defence spending increased significantly from around 10% and 12% in 1950 to about 26% and 24% in 2010 respectively. Education spending rose slightly from around 15% in 1950 to nearly 18% in 1970 before falling slightly to roughly 14% in 2010. Transport spending fell steadily from around 18% in 1950 to approximately 9% in 2010. In summary, health and defence spending in Australia increased to around half of the nation’s expenditure by 2010 (Statistics Australia 2012, p. 47).<strong>special bar chart</strong></p><h3 id="Line-chart">Line chart</h3><p>eg. The line graph compares the fluctuations in trends in the numbers of different types of students enrolled at the University of Tuba from 2008 to 2014. The number of fulltime students rose significantly from about 1000 in 2008 to around 1900 in 2014. The number of part-time students was lower, at about 800 in 2008, but this increased considerably until 2010, after which it rose gradually to just under 1200 students in 2014. Although the number of distance students was only about 400 in 2008, this number rose rapidly to approximately 1500 students in 2014, overtaking the number of part-time students. While the increase in the number of distance learning students was the most dramatic, the largest group of students remained that of full-time students (Lee 2016, p. 13).</p><p>eg. The line graph examines the trends in the annual small, medium and large car sales for March Motors from 2010 to 2018. Small car sales at March Motors rose steadily from around 9,500 in 2010 to just under 25,000 in 2016, where it levelled off until 2018. Medium car sales remained steady at approximately 17,500 from 2010 to 2016 before falling suddenly to around 12,500 sales in 2018. There was a sharp increase in large car sales from about 5,000 in 2010 to a peak of approximately 16,000 in 2014, which was followed by a dramatic decrease to about 3,000 in 2016. To summarise, total car sales for March Motors increased from 2010 to 2014 before starting to fall continuously from 2016 to 2018 (Stephens 2018, p. 51).</p><p>eg. The line chart shows different age groups of Australians and their average weight between 1950 and 2010. During this period, children under 13 and teenagers between 14-19 experienced more than 10 kg average weight gain from 24 to 36 kilograms and 45 to 57 kilograms respectively. The average weight of adults between 20-39 and 60+ also increased slightly. Adults between 40-59 years of age made up the heaviest group of Australians, remaining steady at 70 kilograms until 1990, after which their weight had a slight increase to 75 kilograms by 2010. Based on the above, the average weight of children and teenagers increased the most, while adults increased less (Statistics Australia 2012, p. 72).</p><h3 id="Pie-chart">Pie chart</h3><p>eg. The pie chart displays the percentage of people in different age groups getting news from the internet. The majority people, making up 40% of the whole, getting news from the internet are between 19 to 40 years old. The next biggest group is the young people of 15 to 18 years old, with 35%. For the people between the ages 41 to 55, the percentage is 15%. The smallest group, 10%, is the people who are above 55 years old. Based on the above, majority people getting news from internet are between 15 to 40 years old, making up 75%. (Young 2014, p. 6)</p><p>eg. The pie chart displays the percentage of people in different age groups getting news from the internet. At 37%, the biggest group of people getting news from the internet are between 31 to 40 years old. The next biggest group is the people of 19 to 30 years old with 29%, followed by 41 to 50 years old with 16%. The smallest groups are the oldest of over 50 years old and the youngest of 15 to 18 years old with 6% and 12% respectively. Based on the above, the majority people getting news from internet are between 19 to 40 years old, making up 66% (Young 2016, p. 48).</p><h2 id="Analytical-Discussion">Analytical Discussion</h2><h3 id="Interpretation">Interpretation</h3><p>eg. The findings show that students’ homes were the most popular choice of location for doing research in 2014(Lee 2016, p. 12). This could be partly because the number of distance students has increased dramatically(Lee 2016, p. 13). However, the popularity of the university library, computer lab and other on campus locations(Lee 2016, p. 12) suggest that on campus research is convenient for many students, particularly full time students, who are the largest group of students(Lee 2016, p. 12). Part time and distance students may be more likely to study off campus. Therefore, the popularity of various locations for research at the University of Tuba could be influenced by enrolment type.</p><p>eg. These findings show that there have been dramatic increases in the health expenditure (Statistics Australia 2012, p. 47) which may continue to grow if the current weight trends in Australia continue. [Link1] At the same time, there has also been an equally significant increase in the average weight of children over the same period (Statistics Australia 2012, p. 72) which may result in a number of health problems associated with excess weight such as obesity and heart disease. [Link2] In addition, the average weight of adult Australians has also continued to rise further supporting the fact that the health expenditure will continue to increase if the current weight trends of both adults and children in Australia continue unabated. [Link3]</p><h3 id="Evaluation">Evaluation</h3><p>eg. The important findings regarding changes in the marital status of women may have some impact on Hume society. The change in age of women’s first marriage and divorce indicate that women are spending more of their life unmarried in 2015 than in 1965. This may result in an increase in the number of single parent families or young families with older parents than in the past. Women in Hume see both relationships and having children as more important than getting married, so this may lead to an increase in the number of families with a single parent or step-mother or father. As a result of these trends, social services in Hume may need to focus on a much broader definition of the family than may have been expected in 1965. The prioritisation of employment and education by many women in 2015 suggests that issues such as work life balance, the provision of support such as parental leave and the availability of affordable childcare might need to be considered in order to address any impact of changes to marriage patterns on society and support the women of Hume.(With no source!!!)</p><p>eg. The findings regarding students’ choices of location for the purpose of conducting research may have some impact upon the way student support services are organised and made available at the University of Tuba. The fact that they are doing research outside of the university library(Lee 2016, p. 12)  indicates that students are researching online, so the university would need to provide substantial on-line support services for students, in addition to the apps already provided. However, since more students study on campus, such as the library, the computer lab and other unspecified places(Lee 2016, p. 12) , individual personalised services should also be provided for effective support. Moreover, the study environment in each location should be made appealing and supportive in order to maximise the potential of students.</p><p>eg. The findings regarding the change on average weight of Australians may have some negative effects on people’s health/society. The changes can be seen in the impact that these changes have had on health. As the number of children, teenagers, young adults and adults who are overweight continues to increase (Statistics Australia 2012, p. 72), the Australian government may be forced to increase health spending in order to provide more doctors, nurses and hospitals. As health expenditure is already increasing dramatically (Statistics Australia 2012, p. 47), this could make less money available to the government to spend on other important sectors such as education and transport. If the quality of education falls, this could impact society as there will be fewer highly qualified workers available, and this may result in an increase in unemployment as fewer people have the necessary qualifications to find work.</p><h2 id="Conclution">Conclution</h2><h3 id="Limitations-of-the-research-results">Limitations of the research results</h3><p>eg. The research has some limitations. Firstly, although information has been provided about the locations chosen by students, there is no detail about the difficulties that students may face when conducting their research. Without this information the university might not develop support services that could benefit students. Secondly, it is clear that studying at home or off campus is popular among students, but it is not clear why this is the students’ preference. Understanding these preferences would enable the university to further determine where to focus these support services to facilitate the students’ learning.</p><p>eg. There are two factors which limit the research.Firstly, only secondary sources about the marital status of a number of women are collected. No details were given showing how the data from Young’s research was collected. As a result, the data in the report may not provide a complete understanding of the issues of women’s marriage and employment in Hume.Secondly, another limitation in the research is the number of sources collected.The analysis of the research findings is based on only one report, which does not cover enough detail to help explain why the changes in female marital status have taken place.</p><p>eg. There are two limitations. Firstly, the report is limited in the scope of information provided. The findings show an increase in average weight in Australia and an increase in health spending, <strong>but it does not provide the details of why health expenditure is growing</strong>. As a result, the link between rising average weights and rising government expenditure on health can only be assumed. In addition, <strong>no information about the activities of any age group</strong> is provided or <strong>the reasons for this increase in weight</strong> over the time period. Such data about any changes in their lifestyle activities is directly related to their health status which would enable a better or more informed analysis of the findings.</p><h3 id="Recommendations-for-future-research">Recommendations for future research</h3><p>eg. Future research is recommended in order to determine the type of support that would most benefit students conducting research. In addition, research to determine what factors influence the choice of location for research should be carried out.</p><p>eg. ① Further research is recommended in order to collect primary sources about female marital status, thus providing more valid data to compare with actual changes in current Hume society.<br>② In addition, there should be more sources selected with different perspectives on the changes in female marital and employment status, so as to give a more detailed understanding of the issues involved.</p><p>eg. It is recommended that <strong>further research be conducted to the causes</strong> of the growing health expenditure to see <strong>how much of that growth is caused by weight-related issues</strong>. In addition, <strong>research on activities</strong> done by different age groups should also be done. This will allow researchers to fully understand the impact that Australia’s changing lifestyle has on its society.</p><p><a href="/assets/criteria.pdf">Marking Criteria</a></p>]]></content>

This one-sided presentation can be seen as biased.</p><p><strong>[Supporting example/s]</strong> The author uses phrases like “false view of life,” “negative feelings,” “worrying effects,” “ruin a person’s productivity,” and “negative consequences,” which all carry negative connotations and suggest a critical stance on the impact of social media and mobile device usage.</p><p><strong>[Supporting example/s]</strong> The article starts with Essena O’Neill’s story, which is used to set a negative tone about the impact of social media on self-image and mental health.</p><p><strong>[Supporting example/s]</strong> The statement “They are unnatural images and edited movie clips that are ranked against each other” suggests that the content on social media is artificial and competitive, which can be seen as a biased view against the authenticity of social media.</p><h2 id="Opposing-Viewpoint">Opposing Viewpoint</h2><h3 id="Problem-Solving-Approach-6">Problem-Solving Approach</h3><p>Consider groups or individuals who might hold an <strong>opposing stance</strong>, listing their possible viewpoints and reasons.</p><p>Take the <strong>opposite perspective of the article</strong> and propose alternative possibilities.</p><h3 id="Tips-6">Tips</h3><p><strong>Infer opposing positions:</strong> Find overlooked positive impacts or benefits and imagine the viewpoint of the opposing group.</p><p><strong>Support with logical reasoning:</strong> Use logical reasons to explain why the opposing stance might be valid.</p><h3 id="Template-5">Template</h3><p><strong>Person or Groups</strong></p><p><strong>Alternative point of view</strong></p><h3 id="Example-6">Example</h3><p><strong>Question:</strong> Who might disagree with the writer’s opinion?

They may also argue that the introduction of insects as a food source could be met with resistance due to deeply ingrained cultural norms.</p><p><strong>[Health and Safety Concerns Advocates]</strong><br>They could argue that more research is needed to fully understand the long-term health effects of insect consumption and that the safety of insect farming practices must be thoroughly regulated to prevent contamination.</p><h2 id="7-Summary">7.Summary</h2><h3 id="Problem-Solving-Approach-7">Problem-Solving Approach</h3><p>Review the entire article to extract the <strong>core information</strong>, briefly summarize the main idea and supporting points without <strong>direct quotes</strong>.</p><p>Include the <strong>source</strong> to indicate where the content originated.</p><h3 id="Tips-7">Tips</h3><p><strong>Summarize key points:</strong> Capture the main idea and critical supporting points while removing unnecessary details.</p><p><strong>Paraphrase in your own words:</strong> Stay objective without copying original sentences.</p><h3 id="Template-6">Template</h3><p><strong>A whole paragraph</strong></p><p>· Main ideas</p><p>· Supporting ideas</p><p>· Referrence to the source (Smith,2014)</p><h3 id="Example-7">Example</h3><p><strong>• Answer：</strong></p><p>The article discusses the growing global demand for food due to population growth and economic development, which is straining land and water resources.

The use of warm colors, such as the green of the shirt and the natural hues of the environment, creates a welcoming and harmonious visual experience.</p><p><strong>Objects/People:</strong> The person playing the guitar suggests a leisurely activity that is often linked to enjoyment and the expression of creativity, which can be soothing and therapeutic. The presence of palm trees adds a tropical or exotic feel to the scene, which is commonly associated with vacations and getaways.</p><p><strong>Surroundings:</strong> The coastal setting with the sea and rocks provides a natural and serene backdrop that is often associated with calmness and relaxation.</p><p><strong>Angle:</strong> The front angle helps to frame the subject within the context of the nat setting, enhancing the overall mood of tranquility and connection with nature.</p><h2 id="3-Mood-or-feelings">3. Mood or feelings</h2><h3 id="Template-9">Template</h3><ol><li><p>Describe the feelings</p></li><li><p>The mood</p></li><li><p>Surrounding</p></li><li><p>Colours used in visual texts</p></li><li><p>Use adjectives</p></li></ol><h3 id="Example-10">Example</h3><p><strong>Qustion:</strong> What mood or feelings does the visual text try to create in the reader? Explain how the visual text tries to achieve this? Write complete sentences.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> The image aims to create a sense of curiosity and perhaps a bit of surprise or intrigue. It achieves this by presenting an unusual combination of food items—specifically, a sandwich topped with insects—which is not a common sight in most culinary contexts. The use of toasted bread, fresh vegetables, and cheese suggests a familiar and appetizing meal, while the addition of insects introduces an element of novelty and possibly challenge. The overall presentation is clean and well-arranged, which helps to maintain a positive and inviting atmosphere despite the unconventional ingredients.</p><h2 id="4-Effectiveness-in-supporting-the-Written-Text">4. Effectiveness in supporting the Written Text</h2><h3 id="Template-10">Template</h3><p><strong>Brief Answer:</strong> State whether the visual text supports the written text (positive or negative).</p><p><strong>Explain the Support:</strong> Describe how the visual and written texts are related (or not).</p><p><strong>Analyze the Visual Text’s Impact:</strong> Discuss the role of the visual in enhancing or confusing the message.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Summarize how both elements work together (or fail to work together) to communicate the intended message.</p><h3 id="Example-11">Example</h3><p><strong>Question:</strong> Does the visual text support the written text effectively? Explain why or why not.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, the visual text supports the written text effectively. The image of a sandwich with insects on it directly relates to the topic of incorporating insects into our diet as a sustainable source of protein. The written text discusses the increasing global demand for food. The image serves as a visual representation of this concept, making the idea more tangible and relatable. It also subtly challenges the reader’s preconceptions about what is considered “normal” food, encouraging a shift in thinking towards more sustainable practices.</p>]]></content>
